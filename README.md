svg_drawings
============

I like to use Inkscape to draw things in SVG. I thought I should probably share them with the world. I'm sure that some of these drawings were not made by me, so if you see one of your drawings here, please let me know and I'll remove it or whatever you want.

Files are sort of sorted into directories, and includes both the vector SVG file as well as a low-resolution "preview" PNG file.
